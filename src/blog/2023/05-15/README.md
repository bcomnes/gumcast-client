A new batch of tokens were disabled today due to high usage indicating feed sharing. This was prompted by an increased issue with global rate limiting from upstream Gumroad servers.
If your feed stops working, please log in again and create a new feed, and as a reminder please support your creators do not share the feed URLs.
