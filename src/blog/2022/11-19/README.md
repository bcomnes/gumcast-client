Gumcast has migrated hosting companies which means that podcast feed subscriptions URLs will change.
Podcast apps should update automatically feeds from <code>gumcast-api.herokuapp.com</code> to <code>api.gumcast.com</code>, however sometimes this process fails due to bad podcast client behavior.

If you experience issues with your feed no longer updating, you may need to log into gumcast and generate a new feed URL, unsubscribe from your old subscription in your podcast app and re-add the new URL.
Apologies for the inconvenience. Old podcast feed URLs will work until November 28, 2022.
