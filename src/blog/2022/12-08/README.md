Gumcast shipped improved stream support today. Most podcast clients don't know what to do with hls stream playlists, but some sort of support it (Like apple podcasts).
Ideally gumroad products support media content downloads for the best experience with gumcast. For those that don't however, gumcast will at least get you to the stream URL.
