title: 'A note on token sharing'
---
Gumcast has identified a number of access tokens that appear to have been shared to a large number of users and will begin the process of disabling feeds that meet this criteria.
If your podcast subscription suddenly stops working, or you see a warning message in your podcast feed, log back into Gumcast.com and grab a new RSS feed URL and re-subscribe to the new URL and unsubscribe from the disabled feed.
You will lose playback state most likely. Please ensure that these feeds are not shared or added to globally available podcast directories.
If you are not the subscription owner, please support your favorite creators and create your own Gumroad subscription and then create your personal
RSS feed URL on gumcast.com.
Questions issues or comments can be directed to `support@hifiwi.fi`.
