      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is Gumcast?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Gumcast is a webapp that lets you generate podcast feed URLs for products in your Gumroad library. You can use these feeds to "subscribe" to a Gumroad product in your favorite podcast app which provides many benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playback state tracking.</li>
            <li>New content notifications.</li>
            <li>Automatic downloads for offline use.</li>
            <li>Better UI/UX than the default gumroad mobile apps.</li>
            <li>Consume your Gumroad podcasts in the same UI as every other podcast you listen to.</li>
            <li>Works with audio, video and even PDF documents!</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Why do I need to provide my Gumroad password?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>tldr; Due to a Gumroad API limitation, this is the only way to access Gumroad library content through the API.  Gumcast is working with Gumroad to improve this hopefully soon.</p>

          <p>Gumroad limits their content API to password auth only.  This is the same API used for their official mobile app.  If you would like to use a normal oAuth flow with Gumcast (so that your password is never shared with a 3rd party), please encourage Gumroad to support the "Authorization Code oAuth2" grant type on their content API.</p>

        <p>Your password is never stored, logged or seen by the operations of this service.  All code is open source and freely auditable.</p></dd>

        <dt>
          What data does Gumcast store and wher is it stored?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>All webapp data is stored in <code>window.localstorage</code> under the <code>gumcast</code> key and is limited to a few things like application config, and session data.  This data lives locally in the browser you log in with.</p>

          <p>All RSS feed state is stored in the URL itself in form of search query parameter.  These URLs are stored locally in your podcast app.  The RSS feeds generated by Gumcast should be considered private and should never be shared.  They do not contain passwords, but they do contain session tokens which are tied to your Gumroad account.</p>

          <p>The Gumcast API is hosted on Heroku and never stores or logs your password or email address.  It does however process access tokens in order to retreive your account library on your behalf.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Is this service part of Gumroad?</dt>
        <dd>No, this is an independent, third party, stateless application that uses Gumroad's content API to generate Podcast RSS feeds that can be subscribed to in a podcast app like Apple Podcasts.app.</dd>

        <dt>Does this service mirror my Gumroad content?</dt>
        <dd>No, all content is still stored and managed on Gumroad.  No copies of Gumroad is stored by this service.  Gumcast proxies download links because Gumroad provides short lived download links and needs to generate a new link behind the scene when your podcast app requests a file.</dd>

        <dt>Someone is sharing a Gumcast feed with lots of people. Can you make them stop?</dt>
        <dd>This is the same situation with Gumroad account sharing.  If you identify an account that is being shared with many people, work with Gumroad customer support to come to a resolution with the account owner in question.</dd>

        <dt>Can people still access paid Gumroad content through Gumcast even after they end their subscription on Gumroad?</dt>
        <dd>No, Gumcast can only provide access to what the Gumroad account has access to.  It does not provide copies of content or provide any additional access control beyond what Gumroad itself provides.</dd>

        <dt>As a seller, do I need to set anything up with Gumcast so that customers can use this with my product?</dt>
        <dd>No! All your customers need to do is log in with their own Gumroad account that has access to a purchase your product at Gumcast and they can generate their personalized Podcast feed for their individual subscription.</dd>

        <dt>Can I stream large video/files with Gumcast?</dt>
        <dd><p>Right now, no.  File content unfortunately has to be peroxided through the web app so please don't stream large video through Gumcast. Please download video content in one go and watch a local copy.</p>

          <p>In the future, Gumroad may provide longer lived download URLs which will allow for unproxied content downloads.</p>
